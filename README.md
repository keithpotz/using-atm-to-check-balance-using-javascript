# ATM Balance Checker Using JavaScript

## Overview
This is a simple JavaScript-based ATM balance checker that simulates a basic ATM interface where users can check their account balance. It demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts, user input handling, and basic UI interactions.

## Features
- User-friendly ATM simulation
- Secure PIN-based authentication
- Real-time balance checking
- Simple and interactive user interface

## Installation and Usage

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/keithpotz/using-atm-to-check-balance-using-javascript.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder.
3. Run the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Enter the required details and check your balance.

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structuring the web page
- CSS for styling the interface
- JavaScript for handling user input and logic

## How It Works
1. The user enters their PIN to access their balance.
2. If the PIN is correct, the current balance is displayed.
3. If the PIN is incorrect, an error message is shown.

## Future Improvements
- Add a deposit and withdrawal feature
- Implement session storage for user balance persistence
- Enhance security with hashed PIN storage
- Improve the UI with animations and better design
